# Code Review

I have a few suggestions for improvement:

## Update Dependencies

- Replace `node-sass` with `sass`.
- Consider updating other deprecated dependencies.

## API Endpoints

- Some endpoints have changed and need to be updated.

## Error Handling and Loading States

- Adding error handling and loading states would significantly enhance the user experience.

## Remove Unused Code and Improve Naming

- There are a few functions and variables, such as `closeCard`, that are no longer being used and should be removed.
- Additionally, some variable names, like `isOpen`, may not be clear to new developers. Consider renaming them to better reflect their purpose and improve readability.

## Code Formatting

- Use Prettier for consistent formatting across the team.

## Refactor Code Structure

- To better separate concerns, consider using custom hooks to encapsulate logic related to fetching and managing movies.

## Consider Adding TypeScript

- Adding TypeScript will help catch errors earlier and improve type safety.
